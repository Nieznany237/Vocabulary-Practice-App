# Vocabulary Practice App

**Vocabulary Practice App** is a simple and effective tool for practicing vocabulary between any two languages using your own word lists.

## How to Use It?

1. **Prepare a `.txt` file with your vocabulary.**  
   The file should start with a **header line** indicating the two languages, followed by word pairs separated by a dash `-`.

   ### ðŸ“„ Structure:
   - The **header** is required and helps the app identify translation directions.
   - Word pairs must follow this format: `Language1Word - Language2Word`

   ### Example:
   ```text
   English - Polish
   Astronaut - Astronauta
   Barrister - Adwokat
   Chief executive officer - Dyrektor generalny
   ```

2. **Launch the app** and load your vocabulary file using the menu.

3. **Choose a mode**:
- Language 1 â†’ Language 2
- Language 2 â†’ Language 1
- Mixed (default)

4. **Start practicing!**  
Type in the translation, check your answer, get hints if needed, and track your accuracy.
