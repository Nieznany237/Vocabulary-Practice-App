# Custom Themes

You can use custom themes to change the appearance of the Vocabulary Practice App.

## Creating Your Own Theme

- Use [CTkThemeMaker](https://github.com/Akascape/CTkThemeMaker) (recommended) to create your own theme files.

## Using Existing Themes

- Download ready-made themes from repositories like [CTkThemesPack](https://github.com/a13xe/CTkThemesPack).

## Applying a Theme

1. Place your `.json` theme file in the `Themes` folder.
2. Open the `settingsV2.json` file.
3. Set the `color_theme` path to your chosen theme file, for example:
   ```
   "color_theme": "Assets/Vocabulary-Practice-App/Themes/your_theme.json"
   ```

Restart the app to apply the new theme.
